## 3. Relevance to TCM-Sage

*How does this paper directly help our project?*

- **Concept:** [e.g., "Self-Correction/Reflection"]
  - **Application:** *This is vital for building practitioner trust. By implementing a self-reflection mechanism like the one described, TCM-Sage can validate its own generated answers against the retrieved TCM texts, providing a layer of internal fact-checking.*
- **Concept:** [e.g., "Hybrid Search"]
  - **Application:** *TCM has both nuanced concepts (for semantic search) and very specific terminology/herbs (for keyword search). This paper's discussion on hybrid search confirms it's the right path for our retriever.*
