# TCM-Sage: An Evidence-Synthesis Tool for TCM

An evidence-synthesis tool for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinical reference. This project aims to empower practitioners by providing explainable, evidence-backed insights from the vast corpus of TCM literature.

## Project Background

*Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a complex medical system where diagnostic and
treatment efficacy relies heavily on a practitioner's accumulated experience and deep, nuanced
understanding of classical texts. This vast body of knowledge, spanning thousands of years of
literature and disparate case notes, represents both a profound asset and a significant operational
challenge. For a practitioner, manually searching for analogous historical cases or
cross-referencing symptoms across multiple classical schools of thought during a patient
consultation is impractical. This knowledge accessibility bottleneck can slow down
decision-making, create inconsistencies in care, and steepen the learning curve for junior doctors.
The motivation for this project stems from the unique capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to address this specific challenge. LLMs excel at ingesting and synthesizing immense
volumes of unstructured text, making them an ideal technology to act as a "collective memory"
for the field of TCM. This project aims to leverage an LLM not as a decision-maker, but as an
intelligent clinical reference assistant. By creating an explainable, evidence-backed tool, we can
empower practitioners to query the entire corpus of TCM literature in seconds, helping them
validate hypotheses, explore alternative perspectives, and access a breadth of knowledge that
would be impossible to hold in human memory alone. Capitalizing on Hong Kong Baptist
University's renowned expertise in Chinese Medicine, this project seeks to build a prototype that
demonstrates how modern AI can augment, not replace, the diagnostic workflow, ultimately
enhancing the practitioner's ability to deliver informed, evidence-based care.*

## Proposed Approach

This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture combined with a TCM knowledge graph to address issues of semantic ambiguity and practitioner trust. The system is designed as an evidence-synthesis tool, not a diagnostic agent.

## Project Status

**Stage 1 (Now - Sept 26, 2025): Foundational Research & Scoping**
- [ ] Literature Review on RAG, KG, and TCM Datasets
- [ ] MVP Definition & System Architecture
